"body":" The order from the appeals court came a day after a Honolulu-based federal district judge denied the same request, saying he would not “usurp” Supreme Court orders that had revived a limited version of the travel ban. In its order, a panel of three 9th Circuit judges said they “do not fault” the Hawaii judge for rejecting the state’s claim against how the ban is being implemented.The judges suggested that the ban’s challengers made a technical mistake in their filing in Honolulu when they asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to “clarify” the Supreme Court’s instructions on the ban, instead of asking for “injunctive relief or to modify the injunction” of the travel ban.The judges — Michael Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez — were appointed by Democratic presidents and had previously refused to reinstate the ban in June before the Supreme Court took over the case."
